# My JWLIA Project
This project was a challenge to make a pixel perfect copy of the JWLI site provided to us using only HTML, CSS and primarily using floats to align everything.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS

Using only HTML and CSS, I created a duplicate of the JWLI website, matching the colors using the Digital Color Meter on my Macbook and arranging the content using primarily floats and flexbox. I then made the page responsive across a multidude of divise screen sizes. 

## Lessons Learned:

I learned that it is imporant to create media queries where the page breaks and not at set screen sizes, because the content can break between the wellknown screen sizes. There are more and more devices being made everyday, so it's best to cover your ass and create a website that will look good on any screen it come across.
